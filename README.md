# Hi there 👋, I'm Franco! 🤖

I am a Computer Science student at the National University of La Plata in Argentina 🎓. I have completed courses on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as Python programming 🐍.

👨‍💻 I'm a programming language ninja, skilled in several languages, including:

- Python 🐍
- Java ☕️
- Pascal 🤓
- JavaScript 🌐
- CSS 💅
- HTML 🤩

I'm particularly interested in BIG DATA 📊 and Artificial Intelligence 🤖, and I'm always eager to learn new things in these fields.

At the moment, I'm in my second year of studies 📚, and I'm looking forward to tackling more challenging projects and learning opportunities. 💪

🌱 Besides coding 💻, I enjoy reading 📚, playing video games 🎮, and spending time outdoors 🌳.

Feel free to check out my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out to me! 📫
